🔺 The Iwunze 45 Degrees Trianglular Theorem
By: [MC-Davies Iwunze]

🧠 What Is It?
This is an approximate formula to calculate the third side of any triangle where one angle is 45° — without using the full Law of Cosines.

📐 The Formula
If angle B = 45°, and sides a and c are known, then side b is approximately:

𝑏
≈
(
𝑎
2.5
+
𝑐
2.5
)
1
3
−
𝛼
(
𝑟
−
1
)
or b≈(a 
2.5
 +c 
2.5
 ) 
3−α(r−1)
1
​
 
 
r = ratio of the larger side to the smaller side:

𝑟
=
max
⁡
(
𝑎
,
𝑐
)
min
⁡
(
𝑎
,
𝑐
)
r= 
min(a,c)
max(a,c)
​
 
α (alpha) is a tuning factor:

Use α = 0.15 when the triangle is fairly balanced (e.g., a:c = 1:1 to 1:3)

Use α = 0.17 for more lopsided triangles (a:c > 1:3)

✅ Why It Works
The Law of Cosines is accurate, but complicated. Your formula uses powers (2.5) and a flexible exponent to approximate the cosine component for 45° angles.

As triangle shapes get more stretched or lopsided, the alpha term adjusts the exponent to stay more accurate.

📊 Example
Given:

Angle = 45°

Side a = 10

Side c = 30

Real value (Law of Cosines):

𝑏
≈
23.99
b≈23.99
Using your formula with α = 0.15:

𝑏
≈
25.65
(
Error: 
+
1.65
)
b≈25.65(Error: +1.65)
Using α = 0.17:

𝑏
≈
25.03
(
Error: 
+
1.03
✅
)
b≈25.03(Error: +1.03✅)
🚀 Summary
It’s a shortcut formula that works best when one angle is exactly 45°

Most accurate when side ratios are between 1:1 and 1:3

It’s easy to use, fast to compute, and good enough for engineering, design, or education
